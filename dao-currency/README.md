## Contracts

#### CurrencyDatabase

The currency database contract tracks the currency balance of accounts. It has methods for changing a balance and for transferring currency between accounts. There is an interface version, `CurrencyDatabase` and a default implementation, `DefaultCurrencyDatabase`. The default implementation uses a regular mapping rather then an iterable one, to save storage space, because a normal setup would include a user database with an iterable mapping so the caller might as well use that.

#### MintedCurrency

The actions contracts comes in the form of a minted currency. Users are allowed to send currency to each-other, but only the minter can create new coins. The `MintedCurrency` interface is partially implemented by `AbstractMintedCurrency`, which is the base class for minted currencies. There are two alternatives, `DefaultMintedCurrency` that comes only with the minter mechanics, and `MintedUserCurrency` that requires accounts that send or receive currency to be registered in a `UserDatabase` contract.
